A Gigs/Job app built using PHP and Laravel with Mysql acting as a database backend.
It's a job/gig listing app that allows users to create, view, and share gigs. I'm using Laravel as the framework and Blade template for the front end. For the database, I've gone with MySQL.

<ul> 
   <li>Common Resourse routes;</li>
   <li>index - show all gigs</li>
   <li>show - show single gig</li>
   <li>create - show form to create new gig</li>
   <li>store - store new gig</li>
   <li>edit - show form to edit gig</li>
   <li>update - update gig</li>
   <li>destroy - delete gig</li>
</ul>
