A Gigs/Job app built using PHP and Laravel with Mysql acting as a database backend.
It's a job/gig listing app that allows users to create, view, and share gigs. I'm using Laravel as the framework and Blade template for the front end. For the database, I've gone with MySQL.

Common Resourse routes;
index - show all gigs
show - show single gig
create - show form to create new gig
store - store new gig
edit - show form to edit gig
update - update gig
destroy - delete gig
